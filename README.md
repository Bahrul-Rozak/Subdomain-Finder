## What is a Subdomain Finder?
<p align="justify">
A subdomain finder is a tool used to find the subdomains of a given domain.

Subdomains are created when a second-level domain is added to a top-level domain. For example, the subdomain "www" is a subdomain of the domain "yoururl.com". A subdomain can be created for any purpose, and there is no limit to the number of subdomains that can be created for a single domain.
